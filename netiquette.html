	<h2>Think About What You Post</h2>
		

	<p>As much as you want to share all the things that are happening in your life on social media, think before posting. If you post something mean, do you think it could potentially hurt or offend the feelings of someone else? If so, don't post it. You wouldn't want someone to post something that would hurt your feelings, would you?</p>
		
	<h2>Stay Away From Mature Games and Content</h2>
		
		<p> If a game is rated Mature, don't play it! Unless you have permission from both parents, mature content should not be played nor watched by a kid. Under both state and federal law, kids are legally not allowed to puchase mature rated games without the presence of an adult. Don't trick your parents or guardians into buying a game that you should not be allowed to play. Not only are these games mature, but so are the people who play them. When playing online with random people, they may say inappropriate things no kid should be hearing.</p>
		
		
	<h2>Be Careful On The Web</h2>
		
			<p>You never who and what is out there on the internet! Be safe and don't easily fall for what other people are saying online, so that your personal information isn't stolen. Pop-up ads often show things that might appeal to a young kid, however, a lot of the times, what they are saying is fake. If you encounter a pop-up ad when browsing the internet, ignore it. Pop-up ads can cause viruses that will cause all types of problems on your computer. Also, there are bad people on the internet who will try and scam you out of your money and information. Don't believe everything you see online.</p>
